## Key Features of These CUDA Code
1. **Parallelism**: Use the GPU CUDA kernel to perform various operations in parallel.
2. **Performance Comparison**: Compare the excution time of the CPU and GPU implementations, showcasing the potential speedup of GPU parallelism computation.
3. **Correctness Check**: The results from the GPU and CPU are compared to ensure the CUDA kernel gets the correct output.
